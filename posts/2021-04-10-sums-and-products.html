                <h1 id="post-title">Products and sums, named and anonymous</h1>

<p><strong>April 10, 2021</strong> - Tagged as: <a title="All pages tagged 'en'." href="../tags/en.html">en</a>, <a title="All pages tagged 'plt'." href="../tags/plt.html">plt</a>, <a title="All pages tagged 'types'." href="../tags/types.html">types</a>.</p>

<p>I was recently thinking about why do so many languages have tuples, which can be thought of as simple anonymous products (more on the definition of this below), but not something similar for sums. Both sum and product types are widely used, so it seems inconsistent to have anonymous products but not sums.</p>
<p>I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/_osa1/status/1379260986574667776">tweeted about this</a> and got helpful responses that made me realize that I got my definitions wrong. As I think more about what “anonymous type” means it became clear to me that the it’s not just tuples or other types with special syntax, instead of names. It’s more complicated than that.</p>
<p>So in this post I’d like briefly talk about products and sums, and how are names used in type checking. I will then show a different way of type checking, and some examples from two widely used languages. Finally, I will argue that types are called “named” or “anonymous” depending on how they are checked.</p>
<p>Note that I’m not using any of these words as they are used in category theory or any other field of mathematics. These are mainly how I see them used in widely used PLs like Haskell, Rust, and OCaml, and in PL papers and books.</p>
<h2 id="products">Products</h2>
<p>A value of a product type contains zero or more fields with potentially different types. Some example product types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data Coordinate = Coordinate { x :: Int, y :: Int }</code>: a product with two <code>Int</code> fields</li>
<li><code>data D = D Int String Float</code>: a product with <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code>, and <code>Float</code> fields</li>
<li><code>data Empty = Empty</code>: a product with no fields</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the way you access the fields does not matter. In the examples above, fields of a <code>Coordinate</code> value can be accessed with pattern matching, or with the generated functions <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. In the second example, we can only access the fields with pattern matching.</p>
<p>What matters is: products contain zero or more fields. The fields can have different types.</p>
<h2 id="sums">Sums</h2>
<p>A sum type specifies multiple “variants” (or “alternatives”), where each variant has a “name” (or “tag”, more on this later) and some number of fields.</p>
<p>A value of a sum type holds a name (or tag), and the fields of the variant with that name.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a parser for integers, you will want to return an integer when parsing succeeds, or an error message when something goes wrong. The sum type for the return value of your parse function would look like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">ParseResult</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Success</span> <span class="dt">Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="op">|</span> <span class="dt">Fail</span> <span class="dt">String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here, <code>Success</code> and <code>Fail</code> are names of the variants. <code>Success</code> variant has an <code>Int</code> field, and <code>Fail</code> variant has a <code>String</code> field.</p>
<p>A value of this type does not contain an <code>Int</code> and <code>String</code> at the same time. It’s either a <code>Fail</code> with a <code>String</code> field, or a <code>Success</code> with an <code>Int</code> field.</p>
<p>The way you access the fields is with pattern matching:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">case</span> parse_result <span class="kw">of</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>   <span class="dt">Success</span> int <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="op">...</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>   <span class="dt">Fail</span> error_message <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="op">...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="names-in-type-checking-nominal-typing">Names in type checking (nominal typing)</h2>
<p>If I have two types, named <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code>, no matter how they are defined, they are considered different in Haskell, and most other widely used typed languages (Rust, Java, …). This is called “nominal” type checking, where differently named types are considered different, even if they are “structurally” the same. For example, <code>data T1 = T Int</code> and <code>data T2 = T Int</code> are structurally the same, but you can’t apply a value of type <code>T2</code> to a function that expects <code>T1</code>.</p>
<p>What “structurally same” mean is open to interpretation. We will come to this later.</p>
<p>In addition, all types have names<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, even types like tuples, which may look like they don’t have names, like our <code>Coordinate</code> or <code>ParseResult</code> have.</p>
<p>Tuples in most languages are just a bunch of product types, like the ones you can define yourself. They are often pre-defined for arities 0 to some number, and they have a special, “mixfix” syntax, with parentheses and commas to separate the fields. Other than that, they are no different than the ones you can define yourself.</p>
<p>You can see GHC’s definition of tuples <a href="https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/master/libraries/ghc-prim/GHC/Tuple.hs#L34-L58">here</a>. In GHC, you can use the name directly if you don’t want the mixfix syntax, like <code>(,) 1 2</code>. So the name for an 2-ary tuple is <code>(,)</code> in Haskell, and it has a special syntax so you can write more readable <code>(1, 2)</code> (or <code>(Int, Int)</code> in type context). Other than syntax, there’s nothing special about tuples.</p>
<p>So it’s clear that most languages don’t have anonymous types. All types have some kind of names, and two types are only “compatible” if the names match.</p>
<p>Before defining what anonymous types are, I would like to give two examples, from PureScript and OCaml, where types are not checked based on their names, but based on their “structure”.</p>
<h2 id="structural-type-checking-for-products">Structural type checking for products</h2>
<p>A record is a product type with named (or “labelled”) fields. Our <code>Coordinate</code> example is a record.</p>
<p>In PureScript, records can be defined without giving names to them. For example:</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>f :: { x :: Int, y :: Int } -&gt; Int
f a = a.x + a.y</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>f</code> is a function that takes a record with two <code>Int</code> fields, named <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, as an argument.</p>
<p>Here is a more interesting version of the same function:</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>f :: forall r . { x :: Int, y :: Int | r } -&gt; Int
f a = a.x + a.y</code></pre>
<p>This version takes a record with <em>at least</em> <code>x :: Int</code> and <code>y :: Int</code> fields, but it can have more fields. Using this version, this code type checks:</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>f { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3, t: 4 }</code></pre>
<p>The <code>r</code> in this type is not too important. Important part is, in PureScript, records are not type checked nominally. Indeed, in the example above, type of the record with 4 fields is not defined, and no names are used for the record in the type signature of <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>You might think that the record braces and commas are similar to the tuple syntax, so the name could be something like <code>{,}</code>, maybe applied to <code>x :: Int</code> somehow (assuming there is a type-level representation of field names).</p>
<p>However, even if that’s the case, type checking of these types are quite different than tuples. We’ve already seen that we can pass a record with more fields. You can also reorder fields in the function type signature<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, or in the record expression, and it still works.</p>
<p>So type checking for PureScript is quite different than Haskell tuples.</p>
<p>This kind of type checking where you look at the “structure” rather than just the names is called structural type checking.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at an example for sum types.</p>
<h2 id="structural-type-checking-for-sum-types">Structural type checking for sum types</h2>
<p>OCaml has named sum types, just like Haskell’s. Here is the OCaml version of our <code>ParseResult</code> type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">type</span> parse_result =</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  | Success <span class="kw">of</span> <span class="dt">int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>  | Fail <span class="kw">of</span> <span class="dt">string</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Name of this type is <code>parse_result</code> (following OCaml naming conventions), and it is type checked exactly the same way it is type checked in Haskell.</p>
<p>A second way of defining sum types in OCaml, and without names, is with <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/lablexamples.html#s:polymorphic-variants">polymorphic variants</a>. Here’s the polymorphic variant for the same type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">type</span> parse_result = [ `Success <span class="kw">of</span> <span class="dt">int</span> | `Fail <span class="kw">of</span> <span class="dt">string</span> ]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Crucially, even though we use a similar syntax with the <code>type</code> keyword, this is a type synonym. The right-hand side of this definition is an anonymous sum with two variants, tagged <code>`Success</code> and <code>`Fail</code>, with <code>int</code> and <code>string</code> fields, respectively.</p>
<p>Now, suppose I have a parse result handler, which, in addition to the success and failure cases, handles some “other” case as well:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">let</span> f = <span class="kw">function</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  | `Success i -&gt; <span class="dt">Printf</span>.printf <span class="st">&quot;Parse result: %d</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span> i</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>  | `Fail msg -&gt; <span class="dt">Printf</span>.printf <span class="st">&quot;Parse failed: %s</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span> msg</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>  | `Other -&gt; <span class="dt">Printf</span>.printf <span class="st">&quot;Wat?</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Type of this function as inferred by the OCaml compiler is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>[&lt; `Fail <span class="kw">of</span> <span class="dt">string</span> | `Other | `Success <span class="kw">of</span> x ] -&gt; <span class="dt">unit</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What this type says is that the function accepts any polymorphic variant that has the tags <code>Fail</code>, <code>Other</code>, and <code>Success</code> (with the specified field types), or some subset of these tags. So if I have a value of type <code>parse_result</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode ocaml"><code class="sourceCode ocaml"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">let</span> x : parse_result = `Success <span class="dv">123</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>I can pass it to <code>f</code>, even though <code>f</code>’s argument type is not exactly <code>parse_result</code>. Here’s the full example, run in <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-community/utop">utop</a>: (<code>utop #</code> part is the prompt, lines after <code>;;</code> are utop outputs)</p>

# Tuples: named or anonymous?

Tuples in languages like Haskell, Rust, and OCaml, are pre-defined product
types that are often used for returning multiple values from functions, without
having to define a new type for the return value.

For example, the tuple type `(Int, Int)` in Haskell is a product with two `Int`
fields. This type is similar to our `Coordinate` example above.

Because tuples don't have "names", like our `Coordinate` has, it may seem like
tuples are unnamed, or "anonymous". This is actually not true. Tuples in most
languages are just a bunch of product types, like the ones you can define
yourself. They are often pre-defined for arities 0 to some number, and they have
a special, "mixfix" syntax, with parentheses and commas to separate the fields.
Other than that, they are no different than the ones you can define yourself.

As an example, you can see GHC's definition of tuples [here][2]. In GHC, you can
use the name directly if you don't want the mixfix syntax, like `(,) 1 2`. So
the name for an 2-ary tuple is `(,)` in Haskell, and it has a special syntax so
you can write more readable `(1, 2)` (or `(Int, Int)` in type context).

So it's clear that tuples in Haskell are not anonymous, they have names. But
what are anonymous types then? Does Haskell even have anonymous types? Before
defining anonymous types, let's briefly talk about how are names used in type
checking.

# Nominal and structural type checking

If I have two types, named `T1` and `T2`, no matter how they are defined, they
are considered different in Haskell, and most other widely used typed languages
(Rust, Java, ...). This is called "nominal" type checking, where differently
named types are considered different, even if they are "structurally" the same.
For example, `data T1 = T Int` and `data T2 = T Int` are structurally the same,
but you can't apply a value of type `T2` to a function that expects `T1`.


What does "structurally same" mean here is open to interpretation, but the
crucial part is with structural type checking, types can have different set of
fields or variants and still be compatible. We will shortly see examples of
this.

Now, here's the difficulty with defining anonymous types (and a point of
confusion, at least for me). Regardless of the syntax, I will have to introduce
some kind of type constructors for anonymous products and sums. One might always
consider those constructors as the names of the types (with type parameters
applied for the fields/ variants).

For example, if I use `*` syntax for anonymous products, like `Int * Int * Bool`
for a product type like `(Int, Int, Bool)`, you might argue that the "name" here
is `*`, and the desugared version is something like `(*) Int ((*) Int Bool)`,
and you would probably be right! In many (most?) type systems, including
Haskell's, complex types are made by applying types to type constructors. The
type constructors used for constructing product or sum types can be thought of
as the name of the types.

In that sense I think there really isn't any *obviously anonymous* types where
you will know it when you see it. Every type is constructed by applying some
number of arguments to a "name" (usually called "type constructors").

# Names -> nominal, ??? -> structural

With these definitions in mind, here's my attempt at defining anonymous types.
If named types are type checked nominally (where different names mean types are
incompatible), then the types that are structurally type checked are called
"anonymous".

In other words:

- Nominally type checked types are named
- Structurally type checked types are anonymous

In the simple structural type checking rule we've seen above, anonymous
products (constructed with `*`) and tuples (constructed with the mixfix tuple
syntax) are type checked exactly the same way. Let's add one more rule to make
them different:

- Before applying the rules given before, rearrange the type arguments to make
  the first argument of `*` a non-`*` type.

Example: if I have `(Int * Int) * (Int * Int)`, this rule rearranges it to make
it `Int * (Int * (Int * Int))`.

(This rule effectively makes `*` associative)

With this new rule we now accept these two types as compatible:

- `(Int * (Int * Int)) * Int`
- `(Int * Int) * (Int * Int)`

as they are both rearranged before checking as `Int * (Int * (Int * Int))`.

(Whether this rule is useful or desired is a different matter)

With this structural equality rule, type checking of tuples and products
constructed with `*` are different, and we call tuples named types and `*`
products anonymous.

# Anonymous sum types

Instead of inventing syntax and defining type checking for anonymous sum types,
like we did for products, I will show an example of anonymous sums in an
existing programming language: OCaml's [polymorphic variants][3].

Here's the OCaml version of our `ParseResult` type:

```ocaml
type parse_result =
  | Success of int
  | Fail of string
```

This type is nominally checked, so if you have a function that expects
`parse_result` argument, you have to pass it a `Success` or `Fail`. Anything
else will cause a type error.

Here's the polymorphic variant for the same type:

```ocaml
type parse_result = [ `Success of int | `Fail of string ]
```

Crucially, even though we use a similar syntax with the `type` keyword, this is
a type synonym. The right-hand side of this definition is an anonymous sum with
two variants, labelled `` `Success`` and `` `Fail``, with `int` and `string`
fields, respectively.

Here's an example of structural type checking of polymorphic variants. Suppose I
have a parse result handler, which, in addition to the success and failure
cases, handles some "other" case as well:

```ocaml
let f = function
  | `Success i -> Printf.printf "Parse result: %d\n" i
  | `Fail msg -> Printf.printf "Parse failed: %s\n" msg
  | `Other -> Printf.printf "Wat?\n"
```

Type of this function as inferred by the OCaml compiler is:

```ocaml
[< `Fail of string | `Other | `Success of x ] -> unit
```

What this type says is that the function accepts any polymorphic variant that
has the tags `Fail`, `Other`, and `Success` (with the specified field types), or
some subset of these tags. So if I have a value of type `parse_result`:

```ocaml
let x : parse_result = `Success 123
```

I can pass it to `f`, even though `f`'s argument type is not exactly
`parse_result`. Here's the full example, run in [utop][9]: (`utop #` part is the
prompt, lines after `;;` are utop outputs)

```ocaml
utop # type parse_result = [ `Success of int | `Fail of string ];;
type parse_result = [ `Fail of string | `Success of int ]

utop # let f = function
  | `Success i -> Printf.printf "Parse result: %d\n" i
  | `Fail msg -> Printf.printf "Parse failed: %s\n" msg
  | `Other -> Printf.printf "Wat?\n";;
val f : [< `Fail of string | `Other | `Success of int ] -> unit = <fun>

utop # let x : parse_result = `Success 123;;
val x : parse_result = `Success 123

utop # f x;;
Parse result: 123
- : unit = ()
```

Neat!

# Conclusions

Named types are checked nominally, anonymous types are checked structurally.
According to this definition, Haskell, and many other languages, don't have
anonymous types, as all types are nominally checked.

OCaml's [polymorphic variants][3] are a great example to anonymous sums.

For real-world anonymous products, it would be a shame to not mention records
and row types[^1]. A record is a product type with labelled fields, for example:
`{ a : Int, b : Bool }`. Row types allow (among other things) very flexible type
checking of records, where you can (without subtyping) pass a record with more
fields when less is expected. With row types, unlike subtyping, if you have a
function that expects a record type like `{ a : Int, b : Bool }` and returns the
argument after using or modifying the fields `a` and/or `b`, and pass the
function a record with more fields, like `{ a : Int, b : Bool, c : String }`, as
the return type you get your original record with 3 fields. More concretely:

```
{ a : Int, b : Bool, ..r } -> { a : Int, b : Bool, ..r }
```

is the type of a function that takes a record with fields `a` and `b` with the
specified types, and *possibly* more fields. These extra fields are represented
by `r`, which appears in both input and output types. This means you don't lose
the extra fields if you pass a record with more fields to this function, unlike
in a system with subtyping. With subtyping, if you have a function with type

```
{ a : Int, b : Bool } -> { a : Int, b : Bool }
```

and pass `{ a : Int, b : Bool, c : String }` to such a function, you lose the
field `c` in the return value, because the return type only mentions `a` and
`b`, without the "extra stuff" part as we've seen in the row polymorphic
version.

(As as aside, I'd like to mention that I really like row types. My first
exposure to them was back in 2013 ([1][5], [2][6]): I implemented two type
systems, one with row types and one for a multi-stage language, proved soundness
of the systems, gave a type and term translation from one to the other, and
proved that if your program is well-typed, then the translation of it is also
well-typed.)

My favorite paper on row-polymorphic records is probably (1). (2) uses row types
for algebraic effects. (3) uses rows for variants (sums).
