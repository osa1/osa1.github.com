<p><strong>June 20, 2013</strong> - Tagged as: <a href="../tags/en.html">en</a>.</p>

<p>A few hours ago I had my first interview ever. I had applied to Jane Street’s software development internship position last Sunday(16 June), and they returned to me on Monday(17 June), and we had an interview today(20 June). It was overall a very good experience.</p>
<p>I should say I’m a bit sad about this interview, because I couldn’t answer the questions with details I could answer and I gave wrong answers to some questions that I know very well. Still, I think I wasn’t bad in general. What happens next will be clear in few days.</p>
<p>We started with some generic personal questions like what I know, what I write, why did I applied to this internship etc. and I couldn’t give good answers even to this questions. For example, at some point I’m asked “what do you like about functional programs”, if you sit next to me in a class and ask me same question, I can give you a 50-minute lecture, but while at interview I just couldn’t do that.</p>
<p>Anyway, we then moved to technical question.</p>
<p>As for first question I’m asked to list 5 unix programs with 2 letters. I immediately listed <code>vi</code> and <code>ls</code>, after some thought I added <code>sh</code>, <code>ld</code>, <code>ln</code> and <code>nm</code>. I’m asked for what does <code>ld</code> do, and I wrongly answered “shows dynamically loaded libraries of an ELF binary”. My interviewer later asked me if I ever used that command, lol. It was funny that I said yes and explained how I used it, haha. The program I explained here is actually <code>ldd</code>, and <code>ld</code> is actually a linker(and I knew it very well, even though I have never called it manually). I also gave wrong answer to <code>nm</code>, I said “it shows string in a binary”, which was wrong because that what <code>strings</code> does. I should have said “shows symbols in a binary”. And I use these tools frequently!</p>
<p>For second question I’m asked “how would I count a list of files in a folder and it’s subfolders”. I said I’m not that good in shell environment so I wrote a small Python program instead. This was easy. (btw, I made a mistake even in this code by first writing a Python program that prints file paths instead of counting files, haha. Later I’m warned and I fixed the code :-D )</p>
<p>For third question I’m asked to tell what I know about garbage collectors and garbage collection techniques. I said the purpose of garbage collectors, and then mentioned reference counting technique. Later I’m asked to list some languages that does and doesn’t have automatic garbage collection.</p>
<p>Fourth question was to write and explain a <code>map</code> function that works on lists. It was trivial.</p>
<p>Fifth question was to write and explain <code>fold</code> function. I mentioned both left and right folds, wrote <code>foldl</code> in Haskell syntax and said that it’s a tail recursive process. At this point I’m also asked why is it tail recursive and what does tail recursive mean.</p>
<p>I think one nice question at this part is that the question of “does being tail-recursive matters in Haskell, because it’s lazy by default”. I think my interviewer wanted to test me if I understand orthogonality of laziness and tail recursion.</p>
<p>Last question, which I failed to give a correct answer was “you have a 5-sided fair dice, and you want to make a fair choice between 7 choices, how can you do it?”. Now this is by no means a hard question and I solved harder problems, but at that time I just couldn’t answer it.</p>
<p>One interesting observation I made while I’m trying to solve this problem was that thinking in a language and translating ideas to another one at the same time is hard. After few seconds of silence my interviewer asked me to say what I’m thinking. I was bad at this.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think I did good enough. I’ll post on updates, wish me luck :-) .</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: I’ve just got an email from Jane Street, we will make another interview, this time with someone from NY office :-)</strong></p>
