<p><strong>June  8, 2013</strong> - Tagged as: <a href="../tags/en.html">en</a>, <a href="../tags/cpp.html">cpp</a>, <a href="../tags/lua.html">lua</a>.</p>

<p>For some reason, I couldn’t load my dynamic library(compiled to <code>.so</code>) in Love2D linked with Lua 5.1.5. It was failing with <code>undefined symbol: lua_getfield</code> error. Interesting point is that I could load same library from directly in Lua 5.1.5 interpreter, which is the same thing as Love2D’s Lua interpreter. They’re compiled with same headers and linked with same object files.</p>
<p>I wasted several hours trying to compile Love2D with LuaJIT with the hope of loading my library from Love2D. I had tried loading my library from several different Lua versions before, Lua 5.1.5, Lua 5.2.5 and LuaJIT 2.0.2, and everything had worked perfectly. So I was expecting it to work with Love2D’s Lua interpreter too.</p>
<p>The problem was that Love2D’s configure script was not using environment variables to look for headers/object files. I was using same environment variables to build some other programs that use LuaJIT, and only Love2D had that problem.</p>
<p>To overcome this, I had to install LuaJIT to <code>/usr/</code>. There no way to compile Love2D with LuaJIT other than installing LuaJIT to <code>/usr/</code>. Installing <code>/usr/local/</code> doesn’t work. Setting environment variables(<code>LDFLAGS</code>, <code>LIBS</code> and <code>CPPFLAGS</code>) doesn’t work.</p>
<p>After that, I could compile Love2D. But that wasn’t enough because then generated executable was failing with <code>libluajit-5.1.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</code>. The reason of this error is latest version of LuaJIT generates a library file with different name: <code>libluajit-5.1.so.2.0.2</code>. This makes sense, I think most C/C++ libraries use same naming conventions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, renaming it works. Just rename that so file with required file.</p>
<p>I’m working on some Lua libraries written in C++, and testing gets painful when you can’t be sure which libraries you’re library is linked against. For this reason I don’t install Lua to <code>/usr</code> or <code>/usr/local</code>, and manually specify header/object file locations while compiling my library. So I removed all LuaJIT files from <code>/usr/lib</code>, <code>/usr/include</code>, etc. But to make Love2D work, I need <code>libluajit-5.1.so.2</code>. So I created a <code>lib</code> folder in my home dir, moved LuaJIT file there, and add that folder to <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable. With this, I had a Love2D working with latest LuaJIT.</p>
<p>Hope this helps other people who want LuaJIT enabled Love2D on Linux.</p>
