<p><strong>September  4, 2016</strong> - Tagged as: <a href="../tags/en.html">en</a>.</p>

<p>After two years as a PhD student at Indiana University, I finally decided to move to the industry, and I’m currently available for job offers.</p>
<p>For the most part I really enjoyed my time here at Indiana University. I still think that IU is the ideal place for someone like me to pursue a PhD. We have a great <a href="http://wonks.github.io/">programming languages group</a>, and the group I work more closely (with <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rrnewton/homepage.html">my advisor</a>) is doing lots of hacking, on GHC (we have two core GHC developers in our group!), various Haskell libraries like <a href="https://github.com/iu-parfunc/lvars">lvish</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rrnewton/papers/pldi16-crossmod.pdf">runtime binary instrumentation tools</a>, which I really enjoy.</p>
<p>But publications are still a big part of the life as a PhD student, and I really, really disliked everything about publishing a paper. I’ve never wanted to have great publications, I’m more interested in learning about programming languages, compilers, and related tools, and contributing to projects that I believe are contributing to the community (which is one of my motivations when contributing to GHC). I want to have a deep understanding of fundamentals of programming languages and compilers, but I also want to develop as a programmer and software engineer.</p>
<p>Graduate school just didn’t let me do these as much as I’d like, and instead forced me to write papers. After about a year it started to become clear to me that academia is not the right place for me because I will probably never enjoy writing papers or grant proposals. So I realized that the long road to PhD in the US (about 6 years usually, followed by more years as postdoc) will be mostly a waste of time, and I won’t be as successful as I want because I don’t enjoy publishing papers.</p>
<p>Sure, I can be a PL researcher/developer in the industry after a PhD. But I believe if I can find a somewhat related job right now, in a few years I can be a PL researcher/developer, without wasting my 3-4 years suffering while trying to publish papers. If I can’t find such a job, well, I think I’ll still be happier because at least I’ll be programming and be much more productive.</p>
<p>So I decided that it’s best for me to do the switch as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, send me an email and let’s have a chat.</p>
